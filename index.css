/*
DESCRIPTION:
Your job is to style the the individual items so that they look like content cards,
just like what we have in the slides. Each item has a title and a description.

You should use CSS grid for the layout:

- On mobile phones, one column per row
- On tablet, two columns per row
- On desktop, three columns per row

Use media queries to make the page responsive.
For the page width:

- From 0 to 480px should be for mobile
- Between 480px and 1025px should be for tablets
- Above 1025px should be for desktop

Feel free to choose your own colors and you can even go ahead to make your cards
look completely different. Just follow the layout!
